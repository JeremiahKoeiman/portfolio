# My portfolio

What you have in front of you is portfolio of the projects I have created. But I also have other branches called "gamewebshop", "
laravelProject1" and "wordpress". These branches respectively contain a gamewebshop that I created using HTML, CSS, PHP & Bootstrap. 

In this gamewebshop you can register, login, order products and change your data. You can also login as an admin using the following data: email = "admin@admin.nl" and password = "admin12345". When you are logged in as an admin, you can see all the customers, change their data & delete them. But you can't delete an admin.

In the "laravelProject1" branch you will find a Laravel CRUD.

And in the "wordpress" branch you will find a wordpress website that I created. The usernam is "Jeremiah" and the password is "Rj$kxrJY0h3NqetHf8PmeZX3". DO NOT UNZIP THE ARCHIVE CALLED: "20190430_fotografiefilmwebdesign_258fa498df66bc719084_20190430101511_archive", but copy both the zip and installer.php and open the installer.php. The installation will explain itself.

This will give you overview of the experience that I have.

# Coming soon...
I am going to start a new project very soon. I am going to make this project with 2 other classmates. We are going to make an gmail bot which will able to send automatic emails and put given emailadresses in the spam box. For this project we are going to use React + Redux, NodeJs and Firebase. The front and backend will have separate repositories of which I will put the links to them in this readme.
