# My portfolio

What you have in front of you is portfolio of the projects I have created. But I also have other branches called "gamewebshop", "
laravelProject1" and "wordpress". These branches respectively contain a gamewebshop that I created using HTML, CSS, PHP & Bootstrap. 

In this gamewebshop you can register, login, order products and change your data. You can also login as an admin using the following data: email = "admin@admin.nl" and password = "admin12345". When you are logged in as an admin, you can see all the customers, change their data & delete them. But you can't delete an admin.

In the "laravelProject1" branch you will find a Laravel CRUD.

And in the "wordpress" branch you will find a wordpress website that I created. The usernam is "Jeremiah" and the password is "Rj$kxrJY0h3NqetHf8PmeZX3". DO NOT UNZIP THE ARCHIVE CALLED: "20190430_fotografiefilmwebdesign_258fa498df66bc719084_20190430101511_archive", but copy both the zip and installer.php and open the installer.php. The installation will explain itself.

This will give you overview of the experience that I have.
